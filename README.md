# Amazon Product Scraper
This Python script scrapes product data from Amazon and saves it into a CSV file.
This project involves creating a web scraper for Amazon product pages. The scraper retrieves the HTML content of the specified Amazon product page using the `requests` library and parses it with `BeautifulSoup`. It extracts essential information such as product name, link, price, rating, and number of reviews from the HTML structure. The data is then stored in a CSV file using the `csv` module. The scraper handles pagination to extract data from multiple pages if necessary. Error handling mechanisms are implemented to manage missing data or connection issues gracefully. It's essential to comply with Amazon's terms of service and robots.txt file while ensuring the scraper operates responsibly. Finally, documentation and optimization of the code ensure clarity, efficiency, and readability.
